Pet Shop Website Idea:

Our group will be creating a pet shop website for both the custsomer and the employee. In our website the user will be able to log
into their account either as a customer or as an employee and if they do not have an account they will also be given the chance to 
create their account. They will both be asked to create a username and a password. The difference between the customer and the employee
is that the customer will have to input a password that starts with a number 1 and then they will also have to include the amount they 
have in their bank account, while the employee will only have to input a password that starts with the number 2. Once the account has been
created they will be able to log in. If a customer logs in they will have the chance to either buy or return something. If an employee
logs in they will have the chance to update the inventory.
